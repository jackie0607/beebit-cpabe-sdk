A. INSTALLATION

1. Prerequisites:
The following packages must be installed - m4, flex, bison, libssl-dev, libgmp-dev (>4.0.0), and libglib2.0-dev (>2.0.0).

2. Install PBC library (Source: https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/)
cd pbc-0.5.14
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-pic
make
sudo make install

3. Install libbswabe library (Source: http://acsc.cs.utexas.edu/cpabe/)
cd libbswabe-0.9
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make CC="gcc -fPIC"
sudo make install

4. Build beebit-cpabe-sdk
make
sudo make install

B. LIBRARY TESTING
cd example
./cpabe-setup		you will get a master key (mstKey) and a public key (pubKey)
./cpabe-keygen		you will get a secret key (secKey_ok) with attributes (bob, male, role=1) and 
			             a secret key (secKey_ng) with attributes (alice, female, role=3)
./cpabe-enc		data is encrypted as data.cpabe with pubKey
./cpabe-dec		first, data.cpabe can not be decrpyed with secKey_ng
			second, data.cpabe can be decrypted with secKey_ok
./cpabe-encdec		you can input a message, then this message will be encrypted with pubKey and decrypted with secKey_ok
